Utility library for the Python [bpc](https://github.com/pybpc/bpc) backport compiler.

Currently, the three individual tools ([f2format](https://github.com/pybpc/f2format), [poseur](https://github.com/pybpc/poseur), [walrus](https://github.com/pybpc/walrus)) depend on this repo. The bpc compiler is a work in progress.
